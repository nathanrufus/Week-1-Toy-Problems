Week 1 Toy problems Prerequisites

Overview This project consist of 3 challenges all created using javascript as its main language: 

challenge 1:Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem) writes a function that calculates the student marks and prompts or displays to the user the student marks.

challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem) This program prompts the user to enter a number that represents the speed of a car. If the entered speed is less than or equal to 70, the console will output "Ok". Otherwise, the code calculates the number of demerit points for driving over the speed limit, where every 5 km/h over the limit results in one demerit point. The calculated number of demerit points is then outputted to the console. If the number of demerit points is greater than 12, which is the maximum number allowed before a license suspension, the console will output "License suspended".

CHallenge 3:Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem): The program first prompts the user to enter their basic salary and benefits.  GRoss salary  is then calculated by adding the two inputs.

Next, it calculates the payee (income tax) based on the gross salary using progressive tax rates: different tax rates apply depending on the amount of gross salary earned.

It also calculates NHIF (National Hospital Insurance Fund) deductions based on the gross salary using a graduated scale, where the deduction amount increases as the gross salary increases.

additionally, it calculates NSSF (National Social Security Fund) deductions based on 6% of the gross salary or a maximum of Kshs. 1,800.
